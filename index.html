                <p>Clara Henderson , a 25 year old mother from  Kleerberga said “ My carpet has never looked this clean ever since I bought it considering the fact that Brandon (her two year old son) is always hands on and messes the house. It has been difficult for me to remove the stains but SquikClean was able to define the odd. I definitely recommend their services to domestic and large office spaces -  and ESPECIALLY TO NEW MOMS!!!.’’</p>
